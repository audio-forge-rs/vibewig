Before ending this session, prepare for seamless handoff:

1. **Update docs/progress.md** with:
   - What was accomplished this session
   - Current state of work
   - Any blockers or important context
   - What should be tackled next

2. **Commit any uncommitted work** with clear message

3. **Update docs/features.json** if any feature status changed

4. **Note anything unusual** - edge cases discovered, decisions made, etc.

This ensures the next session can pick up exactly where we left off.
